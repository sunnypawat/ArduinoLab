# ArduinoLab
All codes from COMP PROG LAB class from my freshman year

## Message to all freshman
This class is self-learning. They teach you nothing about the Arduino and C programming.
The reason that they choose M5Stack is because the answer on the internet was hard to find.
Good luck on COMP PROG LAB class!

## Important notes
Some of the codes from early weeks are hard to read and very unorganize. This is because I knew nothing when I first apply for this class.
